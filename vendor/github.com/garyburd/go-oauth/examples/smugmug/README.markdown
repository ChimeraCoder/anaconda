This example shows how to use the oauth package with SmugMug.

The examples require a configuration file containing a consumer key and secret:

1. Apply for an API key at http://www.smugmug.com/hack/apikeys
2. $ cp config.json.example config.json.
3. Edit config.json to include your Smugmug client key and secret from step 1.


To run the web example:

1. $ go run main.go
2. Go to http://127.0.0.1:8080/ in a browser to try the application.
